## Tasks
In this generator, tasks are used for generating specific files. Some tasks generate a single file, some generate multiple files, and some tasks are just aliases for running "groups" of tasks. At least for this generator, the goal is to make it as easy as possible for you to create your own a-la-carte generator experience.

**Running tasks**

To run a task, just run `$ gen project:` followed by the name of the task to run. For example, the following command will run the `minimal` task:

```sh
$ gen project:minimal
```
### Available tasks

## Next steps
### Running unit tests

It's never too early to begin running unit tests. When you're ready to get started, the following command will ensure the project's dependencies are installed then run all of the unit tests:

```sh
$ npm install && test
```

### Publishing your generator

If you're tests are passing and you're ready to publish your generator to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com), you can do that now with the following command:

**Are you sure you're ready?!**

Let's go!

```sh
$ npm publish
```
