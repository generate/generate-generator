The following files trees are automatically generated by a task in [verbfile.js](verbfile.js).

- [dest files](#generated-files): trees representing the actual generated "dest" files for each task
- [source files](#source-files): trees representing the source files and templates used by each task

_(See Generate's [customization documentation][docs]{customization.md} to learn how to override individual templates.)_

### Generated files

> Files generated by each task

Diffs are base on files generated by the `default` task. Note that some tasks generate files that have different contents but the file path is unchanged (for example, the contents of `index.js` differs based on the task). These files won't show in the diff.

{%= increaseHeadings(include("trees-dest")) %}

### Source files

> Source files or templates that are used by each task

{%= increaseHeadings(include("trees-src")) %}
